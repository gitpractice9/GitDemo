# GitDemo
Here i am working on git with github.
Day1:
Worked on git downloading,installation and how to run a git commands on terminal and in github
Commands Used:
config,init,add,commit,remote,push.
> After pushing the file into remote,refresh the github page to see the file changes.
> We have another way to get a project into remote.By importing existing project into github,we have to give ssh url of existing 
  github project and click on begin import button
> There is an options newfile,browse files in github to add a newfiles directly in github.
> After adding or changing the files,We have to pull that changes into our local repository.
  For that we have fetch,merge and direct pull commands.
> Suppose,if we want to revert our commits,We have to run git revert command along with commit id which we want to revert.
> Suppose if we are working in a organization and belongs to any team.For example Here i have one organization named as "gitschool" and 
   it contains 4 memebers(X,Y,Z and O) and 1 team named as "ExploreGit".
> And everyone is on master branch which is default.
> In that 4,One is owner/lead and 3 are members.
> This team is working on same feature in a aproject.,So the lead will share that project in team.
  Everyone in a team will get that project in their github accounts.We have excellent branching concept in git.So everyone in team will 
  create a new local branch and started working on that feature.
> Suppose if X and Y are working on a same piece of code the one who committed first,his code only get committed.For others 
   it wont allow to edit and commit changes.
> So we have pull request concept to commit all members changes to leads account.
> After making changes,click on pull request option and add description for understanding.
> The pull request will Send to Leads account and also he get notifications through email.So,as a lead he will open all 
  pull requests and merge code which he likes and he will close pull requests.
> Everyone in ateam will get notifications about every action in a github on particaual feature.
> And everyone able to find commit history,number of branches and merged files.
